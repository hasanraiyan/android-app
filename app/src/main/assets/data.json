There is only a single horse available for escape. The soldiers agree to a pact to determine which of them is to escape and summon help. They form a circle, and a number (n) and one of their names are picked from a hat. Beginning with the soldier whose name is picked, they begin to count clockwise around the circle. When the count reaches (n), that soldier is removed from the circle, and the count begins again with the next soldier. The eliminated soldier is no longer a part of the circle. The process continues until one soldier remains and takes the horse to summon help.\nSuppose n=3 and there are five soldiers who form a circle in the order A, B, C, D and E. Let the soldier to start with A, so C is eliminated first, then A gets eliminated second, then E at third, finally B gets eliminated. So D is the one who escapes with the horse.\nWrite a function in C which displays the names of every soldier in the order of their elimination and finally the name of the soldier left, using circular linked list.

There is only a single horse available for escape. The soldiers agree to a pact to determine which of them is to escape and summon help. They form a circle, and a number (n) and one of their names are picked from a hat. Beginning with the soldier whose name is picked, they begin to count clockwise around the circle. When the count reaches (n), that soldier is removed from the circle, and the count begins again with the next soldier. The eliminated soldier is no longer a part of the circle. The process continues until one soldier remains and takes the horse to summon help.\nSuppose n=3 and there are five soldiers who form a circle in the order A, B, C, D and E. Let the soldier to start with A, so C is eliminated first, then A gets eliminated second, then E at third, finally B gets eliminated. So D is the one who escapes with the horse.\nWrite a function in C which displays the names of every soldier in the order of their elimination and finally the name of the soldier left, using circular linked list.
